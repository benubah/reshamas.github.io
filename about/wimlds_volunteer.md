### Marketing
- Initiated the summary and reporting of WiMLDS chapter data to communicate our reach publicly:
    - [2019 Q1 report](https://reshamas.github.io/wimlds-2019-q1-report/)
    - [2018 Annual report](https://reshamas.github.io/wimlds-2018-annual-report/)
    - [October 2018 report:  initial report](https://reshamas.github.io/overview-of-wimlds-chapters/)
- Worked with local chapters to bring meetup chapters under WiMLDS ownership and tag the meetup groups so live statistics could easily be retrievable:  [Meetup WiMLDS MAP](https://www.meetup.com/topics/wimlds/)
- Presented at O'Reilly AI [NYC 2019 Better Together Diversity Luncheon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxJ-j38gcU)
- Implemented consistent "Welome Messages" for all meetup chapters so links to social media forums were directly accessible to increase followers on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and more.

### Global Chapters Support
- Recruited two new members to join global team from Europe and Kenya to increase global representation
- Created a "zap" on Zapier:  a system to manage new organizers (now over 150) to the meetup group and process their applications so they can be added to the wimlds website.  This improved efficiency, saved time and ensure more organizers were added to our website.
- Recruited and guided a volunteer to create and design our website.  This project was initiated and overseen by me in 2016.
- Created project to create [WiMLDS Overview Slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N8O4iFNDHXHQFkizqcoVINvYeNt9_NlxhYqKVXHy1RU) so organizers worldwide would be able to share history and statistics about WiMLDS
- Created [5 Years (birthday) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnCc_XiOL_Q)
- Created [Conferences List](https://github.com/WiMLDS/conferences) for community
- Supported global chapters by responding to inquiries, processing payments, etc.
