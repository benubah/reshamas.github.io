### Tips
- Can get things done if people respect you.
  - When you are good [at your job], people afford you a lot of liberties to do what you want.
- Own your space.  That says a lot about you and your confidence.
- Don't be afraid.  If something is not appropriate, don't accept it.
- Humor works well.  Don't want to offend people.
- It is important to have friends.
- Hard work isn't enough. You have to take care of yourself.
  - No one looks out for you, but you.
- Channel your efforts in a way that will work.
- Hard work and results are important.
- Women tend to listen better.
- Don't be afraid if you are the only woman.  Your gift is that you are memorable.
- Swim like a duck.  Turn up strong, freak out later.  
- We are all guilty of some unconscious biases.  

#### Networking
- Find a connection that you didn't have before [at an event].
