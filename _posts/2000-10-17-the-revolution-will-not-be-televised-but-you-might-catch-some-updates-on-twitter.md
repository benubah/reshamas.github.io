## My Favorite Takeaways

### Lisa Martinez:  "Big Little Truths"
Lisa has worked at Google for nearly 15 years, in various technologies.  She shared that at one point she went to work on Google AdWords because that was the "bread and butter" of the company, and she really wanted to understand it.  Her experience and wisdom were enlightening and inspiring.  These were my favorite shares from her talk:
- Trust your channels
  - that they have good intentions
  - always come from a good place
- Accept change, embrace change
- Invest in people, not projects
- Some men are heroes
- Let go of your Legos.  [Build a project and let it go.]
- Health is under-valued
- Reward yourself
- Word hard and be nice to people
- If you're in the room, add value
- Look for inspiring people around you

#### To Be Bold at Google Means
- Become a lifelong learner
- Accept failure
- Look for ways to make a difference
- Earn respect through work, not from a title
- Take risks

#### Presenting to High-level Executives
- The higher the executive, the briefer you need to be
- Know your numbers
- Lead *with* the data, but *you* tell the story!
- 3 key points
  - Here is where I am
  - Here is where I am stuck
  - Here is where I need help

#### Her advise to her younger self
Wish I had been more my authentic self.

### Lauren Hasson:  Become a Negotiat[Her]
Lauren is a full-time software engineer, and founded a company called DevelopHer to empower women to own their careers and negotiate their salaries.  She told a breathtaking story of how she was grossly underpaid relative to a less experience male co-working who she was training.  She did extensive research and **tripled her base salary** in less than 2 years!

My favorite takeway:
1.  Ground yourself in data!
  - data on salary
  - leverage data:  business needs & pain points
2.  Arm yourself with questions to handle pushback!
3.  Know when to walk away!

### Natalie Villalobos:  Women Techmakers Program & Updates
Natalie has been at Google for 9 years and is the Global Head of Women Techmakers.  

Natalie mentioned the phrase **"The revolution will not be televised"** as an analogy to empowering women where they are.  Women Techmaker leads are having a significant impact on their community at the grassroots level, and that activity, leadership and programming will have a ripple effect to impact a million women positively.  Women Techmakers will be the driver of that million with these 3 actions:
1.  Join
2.  Thrive
3.  Lead

### Tina Arnoldi:  A Digital Detox is Good for You - and Your Business

Tina has had one of the most non-linear paths in tech.  She is a certified social worker who transitioned into tech.  Some great advice to manage our tech consumption in a more productive way:  
- Routine and habits are easier than willpower
  - keep email [and other browswer] tabs closed
  - use apps to limit social media use
  - set a timer for 25 minutes, then take a break, walk 
- **Voluntarily be bored** ---> that can stimulate creativity
