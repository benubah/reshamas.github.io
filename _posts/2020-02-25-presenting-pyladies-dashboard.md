## Tools
- **Front-end:** Pure HTML / JavaScript, D3.js, Echarts.js, Leaflet.js, Gentellala dashboard template
- **Back-end:** A small ETL infrastructure based on R, Bash and Travis CI that daily retrieves data from Meetup API. The use of this tool is based on previous work for a similar R-Ladies dashboard. This infrastructure provides a way to work with Meetup's OAUTH 2.0 authentication system automatically. The back-end is completely separated from the front-end.
