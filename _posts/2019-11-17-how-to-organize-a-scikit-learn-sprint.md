Below are detailed instructions, guidelines and recommendations for organizing a WiMLDS scikit-learn sprint. 

<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"> <i> This resource is available for anyone who would like to organize a sprint and also for any other open source library (including corporations, meetup groups, conferences, etc.). </i> </span>
 </p>	



 
 
## Intro
**Q:  What is an open source sprint?**  
**A:**  It is a full day (6 to 8 hours) hands on session or hackathon, where users convene and work on issues on an open source library.  Sprints can span 1 or more days.  Beginners typically work on issues related to documentation, fixing error messages, etc. 

##  Key Logistics
These are the key logistics necessary for the sprint:  
- date
- venue
- a Saturday (or Sunday) is preferable  (depends on region); in some cases a week day works best.
- sponsor for food
- find core contributor to faciliate the sprint


##  Organizing the Event

### Sprint Website
Create a website with all information so all organizers and attendees can easily find what they need in a central place.   
- **Owner:**  sprint organizer 
- **Example:**  [Bay Area WiMLDS 2019 sprint](https://tinyurl.com/sf2019-sprint)
- **Note:**  this site is created using Google Sites.  It is helpful to use tinyurl, such as:  [https://tinyurl.com/sf2019-sprint](https://tinyurl.com/sf2019-sprint).   


### GitHub Repo for Sprint
This repository holds more detailed information for sprint day including documents, list of issues, etc.  
- **Owner:**  sprint organizer  
- **Example:**  [bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint](https://github.com/WiMLDS/bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint)
 


### Sprint Application
It is helpful that sprint participants have some experience with Python and scikit-learn library in order to learn from this event. 

It is up to the discretion of the sprint organizer regarding what information to collect based on regional and cultural norms.  (Example:  some regions may not collect gender.)  
- **Owner:**  sprint organizer
- **Example:**  [sprint application](https://sites.google.com/view/bay-area-wimlds-2019-sprint/about/application-form)


#### Git
Git is helpful but not required.  Participants will work in pairs, so it is likely that someone else at event (pair partner or TA) can help with git.

### Scikit-learn Core Contributor
The sprints have typically been led by a scikit-learn core contributor.  These are the avenues for engaging a core contributor to lead a sprint:  
1.  If there are core contributors residing in the city of the sprint, that is the easiest.  The [active list of core contributors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html) is available on the scikit-learn website.
2.  If your chapter is located in a city where conferences are held, it is possible to plan a sprint around the date when a core contributor is in town.  We did that for the Bay Area 2019 sprint.  Andreas Mueller was in San Francisco for ODSC West, and thus the sprint was scheduled for the Saturday after the conference.  
3.  It is possible to have a core contributor fly into your city, if a core contributor and funding to cover their travel is available.  We did that for the Nairobi 2019 sprint.  I asked on the [scikit-learn mailing list] and a contributor was interested.  

#### Funding for Contributor
For funding, first step is to do research on estimated cost of flight and lodging for at least two days for budget considerations.  There are a few options for funding:  
1. try to find a sponsor
2. can connect with the scikit-learn team

 
### Curating List of Beginner-friendly Issues for the Sprint
This list of issues is curated by the scikit-learn core contributor who will be leading the sprint.  
- **Owner:**  scikit-learn core contributor
- **Example:**  [curated issues](https://github.com/WiMLDS/bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint/projects/1)

It's a good idea to email the scikit-learn core contributor two weeks in advance of the sprint and remind them to curate the list.  The list should be ready about one week in advance of the sprint and the link should be shared with participants so they can begin looking at the types of issues they will work on.  

Issues selected are labled `easy` or `good first issue`:  [issues list](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues)


### Event Space Sponsorship   
It is best to tap into your local network and find a venue that can host.  

### Food Sponsorship
For food, sometimes the venue that is hosting can sponsor it.  If not, you can look for a separate sponsor for refreshments.  It is also possible to organize the event without providing food and have attendees bring their own lunch and snacks.  


### Event Helpers:  Scikit-learn Experts, Teaching Assistants & Helpers
In addition to the core contributor, it is important to have experienced users of scikit-learn and Git users who can help answer participants questions.  Try to recruit as many scikit-learn expert users as you can to assist participants in answering questions.  

Other helpers who are familiar with Git and setting up virtual environment are helpful.  Developers who use scikit-learn and understand Python coding, unit testing and algorithms will be able to mentor as well.

In addition, it is helpful to have general volunteers who can help with signing in attendees and setting up food, taking photos and tweeting.  

### Pre-sprint Virtual Environment Set-up
<a style="color:orange"><i> Optional  </i> </a>

Setting up the virtual environment can take some time, and some meetup groups may choose to have a "pre-event" meetup where participants can set up their working environment and be prepared for sprint day.  This is also useful where wi-fi may be slow and cause delays in set-up.  

Instructions for setting up virtual environment are available in two places:  
* [Crash Course in Contributing to Open Source](https://github.com/WiMLDS/bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint/blob/master/scikit-learn-sprint-instructions.pdf)
* [scikit-learn Contributing Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html)

### Pre-sprint Git workshop  
<a style="color:orange"><i> Optional  </i> </a>

You may want to organize an evening Git workshop meetup event prior to the sprint.  Here are some curriculum options:  
- [Git Workflows](https://github.com/reshamas/git-intro-workshop)
- [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

### Donate to NumFOCUS
<a style="color:orange"><i> Optional; Strongly encouraged  </i> </a>

The fee for the sprints have typically been free.  The event has been organized by volunteers.  Attendees should be encouraged to donate some amount (nominal, such as $5 to $10, or more depending on their budget) to support the open source community.  

Donations can be made on the [NumFOCUS website](https://numfocus.org/donate).  For donations, the following information can be provided to attendees:   
- Donation dedication:  `scikit-learn`
- Person to inform:  scikit-learn team

## Marketing
Marketing the event can be done through various avenues:  
1.  Meetup group announcement / event
2.  Twitter
3.  LinkedIn
4.  Slack
5.  Facebook groups
6.  Reach out to other communities in your area (PyLadies, etc.) to share the event
7.  Word of mouth:  invite people in the community who use python and scikit-learn

### Hashtags
The hashtag for the sprints is <a style="color:purple"> #ScikitLearnSprint    </a>

### Social Media Cards
We use [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com) to create social media cards.  

### Preparation Emails
Here is a [template email of reminders](https://reshamas.github.io/resources/sprint_template_email/) to send to participants.  It's a good idea to send several reminders, leading up the event:  
* 7 days prior
* 3 days prior
* 1 day prior

You can adjust the text depending on your location and cultural preferences.

Nametags are highly encouraged.  They faciliate networking.  This is the recommended items to include:  
* First Name (required)
* Affiliation (highly recommended)
* Last Name (optional)
* Pronoun (optional)

### Sprint Organizer Introduction
The sprint organizer typically does an introduction and can include the following announcements.  There is a [list of reminders](https://github.com/WiMLDS/bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint/blob/master/sprint_planning/reminders.md) posted in the GH repo.  
- wifi instructions
- bathroom locations
- Code of Conduct (read CoC, let people know they can contact you or another organizer with any concerns)
- reminder to participants to take photos & tweet and share on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.)
- cleaning up:  *We are in a borrowed space, please clean up after yourself*
- thank venue host
- thank sponsors
- URGs space
  - Speaking: let others speak:  *Two people speak once before you speak twice* (From Write/Speak/Code)
- feedback form:  complete feedback form 

### Pair Programming

Pair programming is highly encouraged, but not required.  Attendees can find a partner sitting near them.  If some people are still looking for a partner, the WiMLDS organizer can connect people at the event.  Most attendees will work in pairs.  


### Social Media
It is important to share the sprint on social media.  It raises the visibility of your organization, scikit-learn, python and open source.  It also helps in the planning of future events.  Raising public awareness of the event aids in procuring event space and sponsorship.

## Inclusivity & Cultural Considerations

### Date of Sprint
Sprints should be scheduled around major national and religious holidays. A Saturday is ideal in many cities, but a weekend day may not be ideal in France.  In Israel, the weekend is a Friday and Saturday and their days off are Sunday and Monday.  In some locations a weekday event may be more ideal.  Explore your cultural and business norms for an ideal day that works for the participants and contributor.  No day will work for everyone, but pick a day that works for most of the organizers and participants and venue availability.  

### Photography
It is important to take photographs and share on social media to bring visibility to women in data science, scikit-learn and open source.  It is also important to be respectful of people's preferences and expectations for photography.  

### Childcare
<a style="color:orange"><i> Optional  </i> </a>

If you can find sponsorship for childcare that is wonderful.  If not, there are some other options, up to the discretion of the sprint organizer:   
1.  Permit partner of attendee to attend to assist in taking care of child
2.  Allow sprint participant to bring children to event

### Mother's Room
Check with the venue and see if the following can be arranged:    
1.  Private room where a woman can pump
2.  Access to a refrigerator to store milk

It is helpful to arrange this accommodation prior to opening up applications for the sprint and include it on the sprint website.  When done this way, an attendee does not have to make a special request and this accommodation gives more applicants the option to apply.  

### Food
Having food that is accessible to people with various dietary considerations is inclusive.  These are some dietary needs to consider: 
1.  vegetarian
2.  dairy free
3.  gluten free
4.  etc. 

---

## Post-sprint

### Follow-up on PRs
While the sprint is a full day event, most PRs (pull requests) will not be merged at the event.  PRs require review by core contributors and making changes is part of the typical back and forth.  It's important to communicate that to attendees.  Some resources and time should be set aside by both sprint participants and WiMLDS organizers to ensure that the work began during the sprint is completed.  

Aim to complete the outstanding PRs within 60 days of the sprint. 


### Blogs
The WiMLDS organizer or an attendee can write a blog about their experience.  It's a good way to document the event, share with the community, and also for procuring future sponsorships.  There can be multiple blogs, as different attendees have different perspectives.  Blogs can be placed in any of the following platforms:  
1.  individual's personal blog
2.  Medium blog
3.  Publish on the sprint event website
4.  publish on your organization website

### Feedback Form
There is a Feedback Form available.  Remind attendees at end of event to complete it. Also, include link to form in event follow-up email.  Share results of feedback form with all involved in organizing the sprint, including the core contributor.  Comments from sprint can be included in the Sprint Impact Report.

- Owner:  sprint organizer
- Example:  [feedback survey](https://forms.gle/BcqYKNe1rYReffEZ9)
- Getting started:  Rather than creating the feedback form from scratch, you can email me and I can copy a previous application, rename it to your city event, and you can edit it.  


### Impact Report
Below are some Sprint Impact Reports I have written.  Feel free to copy the template and edit for your sprint:  
- [Nairobi WiMLDS 2019 Scikit-learn Impact Report](https://reshamas.github.io/nairobi-wimlds-2019-scikit-learn-sprint-impact-report/) (Aug 2019)
- [Impact Report for 2017-2018 NYC WiMLDS Scikit-Learn Sprints](https://reshamas.github.io/impact-report-for-wimlds-scikit-learn-sprints/) (Jan 2019)

It is helpful to include:  
- any metrics
- challenges or issues encountered
- what worked well
- what could be better

Aim to publish the impact report within 60 days of the sprint.
