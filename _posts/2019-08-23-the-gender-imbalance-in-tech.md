## Background

The above visualization was inspired by a table that I had presented to a company to obtain sponsorship for supporting open source sprints for scikit-learn for the Women in Machine Learning & Data Science meetup chapters in May 2019.  I was unsucessful in obtaining that sponsorship, and considered that a visualization may convey the message more poignantly than numbers in a table.  

## Data Table

## Data Collection, Availability and Sharing
Some organizations collect and share data by gender.  The collecting and sharing of key demographic data indicates a commitment to understanding and improving diversity.  It is unsurprising that there is greater data transparency with organizations that have more balanced gender breakdown.  Examples include:  American Statistical Association, American Medical Association and American Bar Association. 

### American Statistical Association (ASA) 
- 2016 ASA Activities:  involvement is by **34.6% women** and **65.4% men**  
- 2017:  membership is **53.7% women** and **45.4% men**
