There is a general understanding in the world of data and coding that the R community is impressively welcoming and inclusive of women.  Python does not necessarily have a reputation for being exclusive, but we do not often hear accolades of its inclusivity either.

## What makes you think R is more inclusive, anyway?

### Open Source Contributions

A study that examined the [gender ratios of programmers](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/06/programmers-gender.html) found that this is the breakdown of Percent Female GitHub Contributors, by Language:  
- R:  **9.3%**
- Python : **2.0%**

While these stats are shockingly low for both groups, R has more than 4 times more female contributors than Python!

### Conference Speakers

The New York R 2018 conference had 45% women speakers.  I don‚Äôt know of any Python conference that boasts that high a percentage.

### Enthusiasm on Twitter
R-Ladies has a designated twitter account to celebrate International Women's Day (IWD), [@rladies_iwd2018](https://twitter.com/rladies_iwd2018)
Last year, on IWD, I noticed blazing R-Ladies activity on Twitter. From March 7 to 8, 2018, they posted over 400 tweets highlighting women in R.  Here is one of those tweets:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another brilliant R-Lady! <a href="https://t.co/x1fhRE5U6Y">https://t.co/x1fhRE5U6Y</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rladies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rladies</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iwd2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iwd2018</a> <a href="https://t.co/bd2Tksseib">pic.twitter.com/bd2Tksseib</a></p>&mdash; IWD 2018 featured R-Ladies (@rladies_iwd2018) <a href="https://twitter.com/rladies_iwd2018/status/972020099166212096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

## How is the R community inclusiveness


## Comparing R-Ladies and PyLadies
I thought one place to begin the investigation is by researching and comparing the meetup groups R-Ladies and PyLadies, side by side.  

How is the R community so successful and what can the Python community learn from R-Ladies?

First step, let‚Äôs look at infrastructure
Enthusiasm
Infrastructure (board vs no board)
Funding
Scope
Foundational:  Underlying field of study:  compsci vs statistics
Prominent Male Supporters



### It‚Äôs easy to find R-Ladies (to speak at conferences)

There is an [R-Ladies directory form](https://rladies.org/r-ladies-directory-form/) which asks this question:  
> Could we list you as someone willing to speak about your relevant R topics/experience?

Here is the [complete R-Ladies list](https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/)

Warning:  the website is *very slow* to load. 

### R-Ladies network is wide

They have [120 chapters in 40 countries](https://www.meetup.com/pro/rladies/)

Below is a list of reasons why I think 

## How is the R community achieving inclusion at such a high percent?
