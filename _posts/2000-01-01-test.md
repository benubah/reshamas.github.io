There is a general understanding in the world of data and coding that the R community is impressively welcoming and inclusive of women.  Python does not necessarily have a reputation for being exclusive, but we do not often hear accolades of its inclusivity either.

In this article, I compare numbers of users in the R and Python communities.  I also compare statistics on the respective women's meetup organizations for each language:  R-Ladies and PyLadies.  

## What makes you think R is more inclusive, anyway?

### Open Source Contributions

[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the machine learning library of Python.  Yet, there is only 1 women in the [100 top contributors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html#citing-scikit-learn).

A study examining the [gender ratios of programmers](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/06/programmers-gender.html) found that this is the breakdown of Percent Female GitHub Contributors, by Language:  
- R:  **9.3%**
- Python : **2.0%**

While these stats are shockingly low for both groups, R has more than 4 times more female contributors than Python!



### Conference Speakers

The New York R 2018 conference had 45% women speakers.  I don‚Äôt know of any Python conference that boasts that high a percentage.

### Membership Numbers
Python is, by far, more widely used than R.  Both languages are popular for data science and analysis.  Python, however, is used widely by computer scientists, web developers (Django), software engineers, and many others.  According to the [2018 Stack Overflow Developer's Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages), this is the breakdown of users:  
- R:  **6.1%**
- Python:  **38.8%**

These are the breakdowns for membership in the meetup groups:
- R-Ladies: **29.5K**
- PyLadies:  **36.5K**

Given that there are more than 6x the number of users of Python as compared to R (loose deduction from survey), we would expect the number of meetup members to be significantly greater.   But, the meetup population for PyLadies is **only 1.25x** greater than R-Ladies.   

### Amplification / Networking / Marketing on Twitter
R-Ladies has a designated twitter account to celebrate International Women's Day (IWD), [@rladies_iwd2018](https://twitter.com/rladies_iwd2018)
Last year, on IWD, I noticed blazing R-Ladies activity on Twitter. From March 7 to 8, 2018, they posted over 400 tweets highlighting women in R.  Here is one of those tweets:  
<p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another brilliant R-Lady! <a href="https://t.co/x1fhRE5U6Y">https://t.co/x1fhRE5U6Y</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rladies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rladies</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iwd2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iwd2018</a> <a href="https://t.co/bd2Tksseib">pic.twitter.com/bd2Tksseib</a></p>&mdash; IWD 2018 featured R-Ladies (@rladies_iwd2018) <a href="https://twitter.com/rladies_iwd2018/status/972020099166212096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

## How is the R community achieving inclusion at such a high rate?
## Why and how does the R community achieve greater inclusiveness?

How is the R community so successful and what can the Python community learn from the R community?

These are some feasible reasons for the R community's inclusiveness:
- Infrastructure (board vs no board)
- Funding
- Scope
- Network
- Foundational:  Underlying field of study:  compsci vs statistics
- Enthusiasm / Priority
- Prominent Male Supporters

### Infrastructure
PyLadies has no board.  I discovered via a deep Google search a [PyLadies Kit](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/pyladies-kit/latest/pyladies-kit.pdf) which I do not see linked on the [main Pyladies website](https://www.pyladies.com/):

>The global PyLadies community has no formal organization behind it; no board of directors, no appointed leadership.
We found that PyLadies growth and success stems from being decentralized and non-bureaucratic.
We do have a few point people that can answer and address general, or non-location specific PyLadies questions. If
you are not a local PyLadies leader, you may do so via our general email. If you are a local PyLadies leader, you may
email our organizers list (must be added to the mailing list first).

[R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/about-us/team/) has an active board.  I am an organizer for both Women in Machine Learning & Data Science (WiMLDS) and PyLadies.  As a board member of WiMLDS, I can say from personal experience that WiMLDS is better able to support our chapters with a board and designated leadership.  It is indeed challenging, since it is a volunteer position, but well worth the effort.  

The PyLadies website currently has [89 chapters listed](https://www.pyladies.com/locations/), but 17 of them are defunct, and that data has not been updated.  Determining how many active chapters and members was a tedious and manual process.  Comparatively, R-Ladies has a [central account](https://www.meetup.com/pro/rladies/) where it is easy to obtain the numbers.  Some of the PyLadies chapters are included in the [PSF account](https://www.meetup.com/pro/python-software-foundation-meetups/) which includes various Python user groups. 

### Foundational
Many R users have a background in statistics.  Membership in the American Statistical Association (ASA) is 53% women.  We can make a rough comparison to computer scientists.  The Association for Computing Machinery is the largest society of computer scientists.  [I have emailed ACM for percent female membership, and I am waiting for their response.]  

The proportion of women graduating with degrees in statistics is significantly greater than those graduating in computer science.  The pipeline of R users and statisticians is rich with women as compared to computer science.  


### It‚Äôs easy to find R-Ladies (to speak at conferences)

There is an [R-Ladies directory form](https://rladies.org/r-ladies-directory-form/) which asks this question:  
> Could we list you as someone willing to speak about your relevant R topics/experience?

Here is the [complete R-Ladies list](https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/)

Warning:  the website is *very slow* to load. 

### R-Ladies network is wide

They have [120 chapters in 40 countries](https://www.meetup.com/pro/rladies/)

## What can the Python community do?
1.  Create an official board or unofficial board
2.  Get more male allies
3.  Connect women in Python with each other
4.  Celebrate the wide scope of Python
5.  Connect the Python communities
5.  Grant proposal
6.  Increase PyLadies membership and track statistics
7.  Involve more women to be contributors to open source

Some of the following

### Action Items
Grant to do this, key endpoints:
Track number of women speakers at conferences and make goals for increasing those statistics
Collaboration between NumFOCUS, PSF and PyLadies
