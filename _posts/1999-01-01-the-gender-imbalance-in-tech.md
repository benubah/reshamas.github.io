## Background

The above visualization was inspired by a table that I had presented to a company to obtain sponsorship for supporting open source sprints for scikit-learn for the Women in Machine Learning & Data Science meetup chapters in May 2019.  I was unsucessful in obtaining that sponsorship, and considered that a visualization may convey the message more poignantly than numbers in a table.
