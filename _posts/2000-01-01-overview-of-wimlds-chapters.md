## History

[WiMLDS](http://wimlds.org) is the acronym for "Women in Machine Learning & Data Science".  It was founded in 2013 by [Erin LeDell](https://twitter.com/ledell).  The first chapter of WiMLDS was in the [Bay Area](https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Women-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/).

Five years later, there are 30+ chapters worldwide in 15 countries and 6 continents.  (Antarctica remains unrepresented.)  Total membership is 18K.


## Mission
The mission of WiMLDS is to support and promote women and gender minorities who are practicing, studying or are interested in the fields of machine learning and data science.
