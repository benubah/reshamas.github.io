## Introduction to the WiMLDS Annnual Report
WiMLDS celebrated its 5th anniversary in December of 2018.  This meetup community has seen significant worldwide growth over the past five years, particularly in 2018.  The objective of the report is to share statistics of the WiMLDS community.

Another objective is to improve diversity by connecting the WiMLDS community with the greater data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence communities.

## Growth
Twenty-five new chapters were founded in 2018, bringing the total number of WiMLDS chapters to 39.  Nearly 50% of the new chapters in 2018 were from Asia, South America and Africa.  The remaining 50% were in North America, Europe and Australia.
