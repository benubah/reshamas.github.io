## Background
In October 2018, I was invited to the Google [Women Techmakers Leads Summit](https://events.withgoogle.com/women-techmakers-leads-summit/).   Attendance for the summit was by invitation to GDG (Google Developers Group) organizers and some tech community group leaders.  I am an organizer for the NYC chapters of Women in Machine Learning and Data Science (WiMLDS) and PyLadies.  I was curious to learn which of my favorite women-in-tech organizations were represented.  This prompted me to conduct further research on what I consider to be some of the most impactful and active women's meetup groups.  Luckily for me, all 6 of them have a chapter in NYC:
- [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/networks)
- [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters)
- [PyLadies](https://www.pyladies.com/locations/)
- [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/about-us/history/)
- [WiMLDS](http://wimlds.org/chapters/)
- [Write/Speak/Code](https://www.writespeakcode.com)

</p>


We can see from the pie chart that Women Who Code has the greatest percentage of members at an impressive 45%.  Girl Develop It comes in second at 30%.  The remaining 25% is comprised of the 4 groups:
- PyLadies:  **~10%**
- R-Ladies:  **8%**
- WiMLDS:  **5.5%**
- Write/Speak/Code:  **1.2%**
