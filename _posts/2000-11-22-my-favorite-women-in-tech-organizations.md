## Background
In October 2018, I was invited to the Google [Women Techmakers Leads Summit](https://events.withgoogle.com/women-techmakers-leads-summit/).   Attendance for the summit was by invitation to GDG (Google Developers Group) organizers and some tech community group leaders.  I am an organizer for the NYC chapters of Women in Machine Learning and Data Science (WiMLDS) and PyLadies.  I was curious to learn which of my favorite women-in-tech organizations were represented.  This prompted me to conduct further research on what I consider to be some of the most impactful and active women's meetup groups.  Luckily for me, all 6 of them have a chapter in NYC:
- [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/networks)
- [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters)
- [PyLadies](https://www.pyladies.com/locations/)
- [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/about-us/history/)
- [WiMLDS](http://wimlds.org/chapters/)
- [Write/Speak/Code](https://www.writespeakcode.com)

</p>


We can see from the pie chart that Women Who Code has the greatest percentage of members at an impressive 45%.  Girl Develop It comes in second at 30%.  The remaining 25% is comprised of the 4 groups:
- PyLadies:  **~10%**
- R-Ladies:  **8%**
- WiMLDS:  **5.5%**
- Write/Speak/Code:  **1.2%**

## Comparing Statistics
This plot shows 5 different key statistics.  
1.  On the x-axis, the groups are plotted in the order in which they were founded.  The year of founding is shown below the group name. 
2.  The two lines representing number of chapters and countries for each group are at the bottom.  
  - Both Girl Develop It and Write/Speak/Code are only represented in the United States.
  - Aside from the US-only groups, for the other 4 groups, we can see a relationship between number of chapters and number of countries represented.
3.  We can see there is a correlation between number of members and twitter followers for each group.
4.  R-Ladies is the most broadly present group.  They have 120 chapters in 40 countries.
