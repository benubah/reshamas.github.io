## Intro
**Q:  What is an open source sprint?**  
**A:**  It is a full day (6 to 8 hours) hands on session or hackathon, where users convene and work on issues on an open source library.  

##  Key Logistics
These are the key logistics necessary for the sprint:  
- date
- venue
- a Saturday (or Sunday) is preferable  (depends on region)
- sponsor for food
- find core contributor to faciliate the sprint


##  Organizing the Event

### Sprint Website
Create a website with all information so all organizers and attendees can easily find what they need in a central place.  
- Example:  [Bay Area WiMLDS 2019 sprint](https://tinyurl.com/sf2019-sprint)
- Note:  this site is created using Google Sites.  It is helpful to use tinyurl, such as:  [https://tinyurl.com/sf2019-sprint](https://tinyurl.com/sf2019-sprint)
- Owner:  WiMLDS sprint organizer

### GitHub Repo for Sprint
This repository holds more detailed information for sprint day including documents, list of issues, etc.
- Example:  [bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint](https://github.com/WiMLDS/bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint)
- To request a blank repo to created, send an email to *info@wimlds.org* with GitHub IDs of users who need access to it, including sprint organizers and scikit-learn core contributors
- Owner:  WiMLDS sprint organizer   

### Curating List of Beginner-friendly Issues for the Sprint
This list of issues is curated by the scikit-learn core contributor who will be leading the sprint.  
- Example:  https://github.com/WiMLDS/bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint/projects/1
- Owner:  scikit-learn core contributor

It's a good idea to email the scikit-learn core contributor two weeks in advance of the sprint and remind them to curate the list.  The list should be ready about one week in advance of the sprint and the link should be shared with participants so they can begin looking at the types of issues they will work on.  

### Sprint Application
It is helpful that sprint participants have some experience with Python and scikit-learn library in order to learn from this event. Git is helpful but not required.  Participants will work in pairs, so it is likely that someone else at event (pair partner or TA) can help with git. 

It is up to the discretion of the sprint organizer regarding what information to collect based on regional and cultural norms.  (Example:  some regions may not collect gender.)

### Scikit-learn Core Contributor
The sprints have typically been led by a scikit-learn core contributor.  These are the avenues for engaging a core contributor to lead a sprint:  
1.  If there are core contributors residing in the city of the sprint, that is the easiest.  The [active list of core contributors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html) is available on the scikit-learn website.
2.  If your chapter is located in a city where conferences are held, it is possible to plan a sprint around the date when the core contributor is in town.  We did that for the Bay Area 2019 sprint.  Andreas Mueller was in San Francisco for ODSC West, and thus the sprint was scheduled for the Saturday after the conference.  
3.  It is possible to have a core contributor fly into your city, if a core contributor is available and if funding to cover travel is available.  We did that for the Nairobi 2019 sprint.  I asked on the [scikit-learn mailing list] and a contributor was interested.  For funding, can connect with the scikit-learn and WiMLDS team.  It is helpful to do research on estimated cost of flight and lodging for at least two days for budget considerations.  

### Teaching Assistants
In addition to the core contributor, it is important to have experienced users of scikit-learn and Git users who can help answer participants questions.  

### Marketing

### Preparation Emails

### Pre-event Virtual Environment Set-up
Setting up the virtual environment can take some time, and some meetup groups may choose to have a "pre-event" meetup where participants can set up their working environment and be prepared for sprint day.  This is also useful where wi-fi may be slow and cause delays in set-up.  

Instructions for setting up virtual environment are available in two places:  
* [Crash Course in Contributing to Open Source](https://github.com/WiMLDS/bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint/blob/master/scikit-learn-sprint-instructions.pdf)
* [scikit-learn Contributing Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html)

## Sprint Day

### Nametags
Nametags are highly encouraged.  They faciliate networking.  This is the recommended items to include:  
* First Name (required)
* Affiliation (highly recommended)
* Last Name (optional)
* Pronoun (optional)

### Pair Programming

Pair programming is highly encouraged, but not required.  Attendees can find a partner sitting near them.  If some people are still looking for a partner, the WiMLDS organizer can connect people at the event.  


### Social Media
It is important to share the sprint on social media.  It raises the visibility of WiMLDS, scikit-learn, python and open source.  It also helps in the planning of future events.  The awareness of the event aids in procuring event space and sponsorship.

## Inclusivity & Cultural Considerations

### Date of Sprint
Sprints should be scheduled around major national and religious holidays. A Saturday is ideal in many cities, but a weekend day may not be ideal in France.  In Israel, the weekend is a Friday and Saturday and their days off are Sunday and Monday.  In some locations a weekday event may be more ideal.  Explore your cultural and business norms for an ideal day that works for the participants and contributor.  No day will work for everyone, but pick a day that works for most of the organizers and participants and venue availability.  

### Photography
It is important to take photographs and share on social media to bring visibility to women in data science, scikit-learn and open source.  It is also important to be respectful of people's preferences and expectations for photography.
