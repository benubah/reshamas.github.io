#### Q:  What is a sprint?  
A:  It is a full day (6 to 8 hours) hands on session or hackathon, where users convene and work on issues on an open source library.  

##  Key Logistics

- venue
- a Saturday (or Sunday) is preferable  (depends on region)

##  Setting up

### Sprint Website
Create a website with all information so all organizers and attendees can easily find what they need in a central place.  
- Example:  [Bay Area WiMLDS 2019 sprint](https://tinyurl.com/sf2019-sprint)
- Note:  this site is created using Google Sites.  It is helpful to use tinyurl, such as:  [https://tinyurl.com/sf2019-sprint](https://tinyurl.com/sf2019-sprint)
- Owner:  WiMLDS sprint organizer

### GitHub Repo for Sprint
This repository holds more detailed information for sprint day including documents, list of issues, etc.
- Example:  [bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint](https://github.com/WiMLDS/bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint)
- To request a blank repo to created, send an email to *info@wimlds.org* with GitHub IDs of users who need access to it, including sprint organizers and scikit-learn core contributors
- Owner:  WiMLDS sprint organizer   

### Curating List of Beginner-friendly Issues for the Sprint
This list of issues is curated by the scikit-learn core contributor who will be leading the sprint.  
- Example:  https://github.com/WiMLDS/bayarea-2019-scikit-sprint/projects/1
- Owner:  scikit-learn core contributor

### Sprint Application
It is helpful that sprint participants have some experience with Python and scikit-learn library in order to learn from this event. Git is helpful but not required.  Participants will work in pairs, so it is likely that someone else at event (pair partner or TA) can help with git. 

It is up to the discretion of the sprint organizer regarding what information to collect based on regional and cultural norms.  (Example:  some regions may not collect gender.)

## Cultural Considerations

### Photography
It is important to take photographs and share on social media to bring visibility to women in data science, scikit-learn and open source.  It is also important to be respectful of people's preferences and expectations for photography.
